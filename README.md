# RazerWaveEffect
Uses OpenRazer Python API to make a wave effect on my keyboard and mouse.

The code is a bit bloated but it works for me and uses about 3% cpu (displayed on linux shown on 6 cores so about 0.5% if shown on windows)

this code is a bit me specific but (hopefully) easy enough to change 
I use a Razer BlackWidow and a Razer DeathAdder Elite as my peripherals on linux

ToDo:
Make a better gradient system. (don't know if i can do it)
Optimize it a bit.
