# RazerWaveEffect
Uses OpenRazer Python API to make a wave effect on my keyboard. And uses RivalCFG to get the wave effect to my mouse.

The code is a bit bloated but it works for me and uses about 6% cpu and is very specific to me but (hopefully) easy enough to change 
I use a Razer BlackWidow and a SteelSeries Rival 600 as my peripherals on linux

ToDo:
1. Make a better gradient system. (don't know if i can do it).
2. Optimize it.
